# House Price Approximation Using Linear Regression

This project implements a simple linear regression model using gradient descent in Python. The model is designed to predict profits based on population data. It uses NumPy for efficient numerical computations, Matplotlib for visualization, and a basic cost function and gradient descent algorithm to optimize the model's parameters.

## Features

- Linear Regression: Predicts profit based on population data.
- Gradient Descent: Implements batch gradient descent to minimize the cost function and find the optimal model parameters.
- Data Visualization: Plots the data points and the resulting linear fit
- Prediction: Makes predictions for specific population values.

## Getting Started

Before you run the code make sure that you have numpy and matplotlib installed
.You can do this by running the following commands in the terminal:
```
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
```

## Output

- Cost at each iteration: The script prints the cost at intervals throughout the training process.
- Linear Fit: A plot displaying the scatter points of the data and the linear regression fit.
- Predictions: Predictions for population sizes of 35,000 and 75,000.
